# Getting Your First 10 SaaS Customers (Without a Following)

"Just build an audience first" is terrible advice for developers who want to ship products now. You don't need 10K followers to get your first customers—you need targeted effort.

Here's how I got my first 10 paying customers for SubSense without any existing audience.

## Why First 10 Matters

The first 10 customers are the hardest and most important:

- **Validation** - Real people paying real money
- **Feedback** - Direct line to improvement
- **Momentum** - Psychological fuel to keep going
- **Stories** - Testimonials for future marketing

Don't scale before you have these 10. Get them manually, learn everything you can.

## The Manual Approach (Do Things That Don't Scale)

### 1. Personal Network Mining

Your extended network is larger than you think.

**Exercise: The Network Map**

List everyone who:
- Works in your target industry
- Has the problem you solve
- Knows people who do
- Would give honest feedback

Then reach out:

```
Hey [name],

I'm building [product] to help [target users] with [problem].

I remember you [connection to their work]. Would you have 15 mins to 
give me feedback? If it's useful, I'd love to offer you early access.

[Your name]
```

**Results:** 2-3 customers typically come from warm intros.

### 2. Community Participation (Not Spam)

Find where your users hang out and be genuinely helpful.

**High-value communities:**
- Indie Hackers
- Relevant subreddits
- Discord servers
- Slack communities
- Twitter niches

**The contribution approach:**
1. Join and observe for a week
2. Answer questions in your expertise area
3. Share your journey honestly
4. Mention your product when genuinely relevant

**What NOT to do:**
- Drop links and leave
- Self-promote in every post
- Create fake problems to solve
- Be pushy or salesy

**Results:** 3-4 customers from building genuine relationships.

### 3. Problem Hunting

Find people actively complaining about the problem you solve.

**Where to look:**
- Twitter search: "[problem] frustrated" or "I hate [task]"
- Reddit: Search subreddits for complaints
- G2/Capterra: Negative reviews of competitors
- Product Hunt: Comments on similar products

**Response template:**
```
I saw your post about [problem]. I totally get it—I dealt with the 
same thing which is why I built [product].

Would be happy to give you free access to try it out. No strings 
attached—just looking for feedback from people who actually have 
this problem.
```

**Results:** 1-2 customers, highly motivated because they actively have the pain.

### 4. Competitor User Outreach

People using competitors are already sold on the problem.

**Finding them:**
- Review sites (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius)
- Social mentions
- Case studies and testimonials
- Job postings mentioning competitor tools

**Approach:**
```
Hi [name],

I noticed you use [competitor] for [use case]. I've built [product] 
with a different approach: [key differentiator].

Would you be interested in a 15-min demo? I'd value your perspective 
coming from [competitor].
```

**Results:** 1-2 customers, especially if you solve specific pain points.

### 5. Content That Ranks

One well-targeted article can drive customers for years.

**The strategy:**
1. Find a keyword your users search
2. Write the best article on that topic
3. Naturally mention your product as a solution

**Example:** I wrote "How to track SaaS subscriptions" which ranks on page 1 and consistently brings in signups for SubSense.

**Results:** 2-3 customers initially, compounds over time.

## The Outreach Formula

When reaching out cold, follow this structure:

**OPENER** - Show you did homework
```
I saw your post about X / Your product does Y / You wrote about Z
```

**PROBLEM** - Demonstrate understanding
```
The challenge with [their situation] is [specific problem].
```

**SOLUTION** - Brief, not salesy
```
I built [product] specifically for [their use case]. It [key benefit].
```

**ASK** - Low commitment
```
Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if it's relevant?
No pitch, just want to understand your workflow better.
```

## Tracking Progress

Create a simple tracker:

| Name | Source | Stage | Next Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Alex | Indie Hackers | Demo scheduled | Send Zoom link | Uses Notion for tracking |
| Sam | Twitter DM | Replied interested | Follow up Friday | Budget concern |
| Jordan | Reddit | No response | Follow up #2 | Posted about problem |

**Stages:**
1. Identified
2. Reached out
3. Conversation started
4. Demo/trial
5. Paying customer

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Being Too Salesy
People can smell desperation. Lead with value and curiosity, not pitches.

### 2. Giving Up Too Early
Most outreach needs 2-3 follow-ups. Don't follow up = no response.

### 3. Not Asking Why
When someone says no, ask why. That feedback is gold.

### 4. Targeting Too Broadly
"Small businesses" is too vague. "Freelance designers who juggle multiple clients" is targetable.

### 5. Waiting for Perfect
Your product doesn't need to be perfect for early customers. They'll help you make it better.

## The Path to 10

- Reach out to personal network (10 people)
- Join 3-5 communities
- Set up problem hunting alerts

Week 3-4:
- Follow up with warm leads
- Contribute in communities
- Start competitor user outreach

Week 5-6:
- Demos with interested leads
- Iterate based on feedback
- Close first customers

Week 7-8:
- Onboard paying customers
- Ask for referrals
- Document what worked

## After 10: What Changes

Once you have 10 paying customers:

1. **Patterns emerge** - You see what resonates
2. **Word of mouth starts** - Happy customers tell others
3. **Content ideas flow** - You know what to write
4. **Pricing validates** - Real willingness to pay
5. **Motivation solidifies** - It's real now

Don't try to scale before 10. Learn everything you can from these conversations.

## Next Steps

1. **Make your list** of 20 people to reach out to
2. **Join 3 communities** where your users hang out
3. **Set up alerts** for problem keywords
4. **Send 5 outreach messages** today
