# Automation Workflows for Developers: Build Once, Run Forever

Every minute you spend on repetitive tasks is a minute not spent building. Automation isn't just about efficiency—it's about reclaiming your time for work that actually matters.

This guide covers everything from CI/CD pipelines to personal productivity automation, with patterns you can implement today.

<TableOfContents items={toc} />

## Why Automate? {#introduction}

The best developers are lazy in the right way. They recognize patterns, build systems, and let machines handle the mundane.

**The Automation ROI Framework:**

```
Time saved per occurrence × Frequency per week × 52 weeks
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
              Time to automate + maintenance
```

If the result is > 1, automate it.

### What to Automate First

| High Value | Low Value |
|------------|-----------|
| Deployment and testing | One-off tasks |
| Data backups and syncing | Complex human decisions |
| Notifications and alerts | Tasks requiring creativity |
| Report generation | Irregular, changing processes |

<Callout type="info">
I built SubSense to automate subscription tracking—something I was doing manually every month. Now it runs in the background, saving me hours and catching renewals I'd forget about.

## CI/CD Pipelines {#cicd}

If you're not automatically testing and deploying, you're wasting time and introducing risk.

### The Modern CI/CD Stack

**For most projects:**
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Vercel/Railway** for deployment
- **Preview deployments** for every PR

### Essential GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm lint
      - run: pnpm test
      - run: pnpm build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod'
```

## Webhook Patterns {#webhooks}

Webhooks are the glue of modern automation. Master them, and you can connect anything.

### Webhook Security Checklist

- [ ] Verify webhook signatures
- [ ] Use HTTPS endpoints only
- [ ] Implement idempotency
- [ ] Add retry handling
- [ ] Log all incoming webhooks

### Common Webhook Integrations

**Stripe → Your App:**
- Payment succeeded → Grant access
- Subscription cancelled → Trigger retention email
- Invoice paid → Update usage limits

**GitHub → Notifications:**
- PR opened → Slack message
- Issue labeled → Auto-assign
- Deployment succeeded → Status update

```typescript
// Example: Stripe webhook handler
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.text()
  const signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')!
  
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
    body,
    signature,
    process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!
  )
  
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'checkout.session.completed':
      await handleCheckoutComplete(event.data.object)
      break
    case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
      await handleSubscriptionCancelled(event.data.object)
      break
  }
  
  return Response.json({ received: true })
}
```

## Scheduled Jobs {#cron}

Cron jobs are perfect for recurring tasks: reports, cleanups, syncs, and more.

### Vercel Cron Jobs

```typescript
// app/api/cron/daily-report/route.ts
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Verify cron secret
  const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
  if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
  }
  
  // Generate and send daily report
  const report = await generateDailyReport()
  await sendReportEmail(report)
  
  return Response.json({ success: true })
}
```

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-report",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

## No-Code Automation {#no-code}

Not everything needs custom code. No-code tools excel at connecting services.

### When to Use No-Code

| Use No-Code | Use Code |
|-------------|----------|
| Simple integrations | Complex logic |
| Non-technical stakeholders | Performance critical |
| Rapid prototyping | Custom data handling |
| Standard workflows | Unique requirements |

### Tool Comparison

**n8n:**
- Self-hostable (free)
- Developer-friendly
- Complex workflows

**Make (Integromat):**
- Visual builder
- Good free tier
- Wide integrations

**Zapier:**
- Easiest to use
- Most integrations
- Expensive at scale

## AI-Powered Automation {#ai-automation}

AI adds intelligence to your automations. Not just "if this, then that" but "understand this, then decide."

### Use Cases

1. **Email triage** - Categorize and prioritize incoming emails
2. **Content generation** - Draft responses, summaries, reports
3. **Data extraction** - Parse unstructured data into structured formats
4. **Anomaly detection** - Flag unusual patterns in metrics

### Example: AI Email Classifier

```typescript
import { generateText } from 'ai'

async function classifyEmail(email: { subject: string; body: string }) {
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini',
    prompt: `Classify this email into one of: [urgent, support, sales, spam, other]
    
    Subject: ${email.subject}
    Body: ${email.body}
    
    Respond with only the category.`,
  })
  
  return text.toLowerCase().trim()
}
```

## Building Your Automation System

Start small, iterate, and document everything.

### Week 1: Audit
- List all repetitive tasks
- Estimate time spent on each
- Prioritize by ROI

### Week 2: Quick Wins
- Automate 2-3 high-impact tasks
- Use existing tools where possible
- Document workflows

### Week 3+: Scale
- Build custom automations as needed
- Connect systems with webhooks
- Monitor and optimize
