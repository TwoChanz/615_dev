# Vibe Coding: Building Software with AI as Your Pair Programmer

Something fundamental has shifted in how we write software. The best developers aren't the fastest typists anymore—they're the best collaborators with AI.

This is vibe coding: the art of building software by describing intent, iterating through conversation, and letting AI handle the syntax while you focus on the vision.

<TableOfContents items={toc} />

## What is Vibe Coding? {#introduction}

Vibe coding is a new paradigm for software development where:

- **You describe what you want** in natural language
- **AI generates the implementation** based on your description
- **You iterate through conversation** until it's right
- **You focus on architecture and decisions** while AI handles details

It's not about replacing coding skills—it's about augmenting them. The developers who thrive in this era understand both traditional programming AND how to effectively collaborate with AI.

### The Spectrum

```
Pure Manual Coding ←──────────────→ Pure AI Generation
                      ↑
                  Vibe Coding
           (Human intent + AI execution)
```

You're still making all the decisions. You're still responsible for quality. But the mechanics of implementation? That's increasingly handled by AI.

<Callout type="info">
The term "vibe coding" captures the essence: you set the vibe—the direction, the feel, the requirements—and AI helps manifest it into code.

## The Vibe Coder Mindset {#mindset}

To vibe code effectively, you need to shift how you think about development.

### Old Mindset vs. New Mindset

| Old Mindset | Vibe Coder Mindset |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Let me write this function" | "Let me describe what this function needs to do" |
| "I need to remember the syntax" | "I need to clearly express the intent" |
| "I'll debug by reading line by line" | "I'll explain the bug and ask for solutions" |
| "Let me look up the API docs" | "Let me ask how to use this API" |

### Core Principles

1. **Think in outcomes, not code**
   - What should happen?
   - What are the edge cases?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Iterate rapidly**
   - First output is rarely perfect
   - Refine through conversation
   - Small adjustments, not rewrites

3. **Stay in control**
   - Review all generated code
   - Understand what's being written
   - Don't accept magic you can't explain

4. **Trust but verify**
   - AI makes mistakes
   - Test the output
   - Security-critical code needs extra scrutiny

## The Workflow {#workflow}

Here's my actual workflow for building features with AI.

### Phase 1: Planning

Before touching any AI tool:

1. **Define the outcome**
   - What exactly should this do?
   - What does success look like?

2. **Identify constraints**
   - Existing patterns in codebase
   - Technical limitations
   - Performance requirements

3. **Break it down**
   - What are the logical pieces?
   - What order makes sense?

### Phase 2: Generation

Now engage the AI:

```markdown
I need to build [feature] that does [specific behavior].

Context:
- Using Next.js 14 with App Router
- Database is Supabase with these tables: [tables]
- Auth is already set up with [method]

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- Handle these edge cases: [cases]

Start with [specific first step].
```

### Phase 3: Iteration

The first output is a starting point:

```markdown
This is good, but:
- The error handling should use [pattern]
- Add loading states
- Extract this logic into a hook

Update the code with these changes.
```

### Phase 4: Integration

Once the code is right:

1. **Review thoroughly**
2. **Test edge cases**
3. **Commit with clear message**
4. **Document if complex**

## Prompting for Code {#prompting}

The quality of your prompts determines the quality of the output.

### The CONTEXT Framework

**C**ontext - What's the environment?
**O**utcome - What should happen?
**N**uances - What edge cases exist?
**T**echnical constraints - What patterns/tools to use?
**E**xamples - Any similar code to reference?
**X**tra - Any other relevant info?

### Example: Good vs. Bad Prompts

**Bad prompt:**
```
Make a login form
```

**Good prompt:**
```
Create a login form component for Next.js 14 with these specs:

Context:
- Using shadcn/ui components
- Auth through Supabase auth helpers
- App Router with server actions

Requirements:
- Email and password fields
- Client-side validation with Zod
- Server action for submission
- Loading state during submission
- Error display for failed login
- Redirect to /dashboard on success
- "Forgot password" link to /forgot-password

Style:
- Card container with subtle border
- Centered on page
- Match existing auth pages

Return the component and the server action separately.
```

### Prompting Patterns

**For new features:**
```
Build [feature] that [behavior].
Tech stack: [stack]
Pattern to follow: [reference]
```

**For debugging:**
```
This code has a bug: [description of bug]
Expected: [behavior]
Actual: [what happens]
Here's the code: [code]
What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

**For refactoring:**
```
Refactor this code to:
- [Improvement 1]
- [Improvement 2]
Maintain the same functionality.
[code]
```

## Knowing the Boundaries {#boundaries}

AI isn't magic. Know where it excels and where it fails.

### Where AI Excels

- **Boilerplate** - Forms, CRUD, standard patterns
- **Syntax** - API usage, language features
- **Transformations** - Refactoring, converting formats
- **Common problems** - Well-documented solutions
- **Explanation** - Understanding existing code

### Where AI Struggles

- **Novel architecture** - Truly new patterns
- **Deep domain logic** - Complex business rules
- **Security-critical code** - Auth, encryption, permissions
- **Performance optimization** - Requires profiling
- **System design** - High-level decisions

### Red Flags

Stop and review carefully when:

- AI suggests code you don't understand
- Security or auth logic is generated
- Performance-critical paths
- Code looks overly complex
- Different approach than codebase patterns

## The Future {#future}

Vibe coding is the beginning, not the end.

### What's Coming

- **Better context understanding** - AI that knows your full codebase
- **Autonomous agents** - AI that can plan and execute multi-step tasks
- **Real-time collaboration** - AI in your IDE, PR reviews, documentation
- **Domain-specific models** - AI trained on your patterns and preferences

### How to Prepare

1. **Master the fundamentals** - Understanding is still crucial
2. **Practice prompting** - It's a skill that improves
3. **Stay updated** - Tools evolve rapidly
4. **Build intuition** - Know when to trust, when to verify

### The Vibe Coder Advantage

The developers who embrace this shift will:

- Ship 2-10x faster
- Focus on higher-level problems
- Reduce mundane work
- Stay relevant as tools improve

Those who resist will find themselves competing with developers who have AI as a force multiplier.
