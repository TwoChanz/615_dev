# Cursor AI: The Complete Guide to AI-Powered Development

Cursor has fundamentally changed how I write code. What used to take hours now takes minutes. This guide shares everything I've learned using Cursor daily for the past year.

## What is Cursor?

Cursor is VS Code rebuilt from the ground up for AI-first development. It's not just another Copilot plugin—it's a complete reimagining of the IDE experience.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Tab completion** that actually understands context
- **Inline editing** with natural language
- **Chat** for complex questions about your code
- **Composer** for multi-file changes
- **@ mentions** to bring context into prompts

---

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Import VS Code settings (one-click)
3. Sign up for Pro ($20/month—worth it)
4. Configure your preferences

### Essential Settings

```json
{
  "cursor.ai.autocomplete": true,
  "cursor.ai.chat.autoContext": true,
  "cursor.ai.preferredModel": "gpt-4o"
}
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts to Memorize

| Action | Shortcut (Mac) | Shortcut (Win) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Inline edit | Cmd+K | Ctrl+K |
| Chat | Cmd+L | Ctrl+L |
| Composer | Cmd+I | Ctrl+I |
| Accept suggestion | Tab | Tab |
| Reject suggestion | Esc | Esc |
| New chat | Cmd+Shift+L | Ctrl+Shift+L |

---

## Core Features

### 1. Tab Completion

The most frequent feature. Cursor predicts what you'll type next based on:
- Current file context
- Recent edits
- Project patterns
- Your coding style

**Pro tips:**
- Let it finish typing before accepting
- Tab multiple times for multi-line suggestions
- Type a comment to guide suggestions

**Example:**
```typescript
// Function to validate email and return error message if invalid
// [Tab] → Cursor completes the entire function
```

### 2. Inline Edit (Cmd+K)

Select code, press Cmd+K, describe changes in natural language.

**Example workflow:**
1. Select a function
2. Cmd+K
3. Type: "Add error handling and logging"
4. Review diff
5. Accept or reject

**Good prompts:**
- "Convert to async/await"
- "Add TypeScript types"
- "Refactor to use [pattern]"
- "Add validation for [cases]"

### 3. Chat (Cmd+L)

Conversational interface for questions and complex tasks.

**Use cases:**
- Understanding unfamiliar code
- Debugging errors
- Exploring approaches
- Learning APIs

**Context tricks:**
- `@file.tsx` - Reference specific file
- `@folder` - Reference entire folder
- `@docs` - Reference documentation
- `@web` - Search the web

**Example chat:**
```
Me: @schema.ts How do I add a new field for user preferences?

Cursor: Based on your schema, you'd add...
[Shows specific migration and type changes]
```

### 4. Composer (Cmd+I)

The power feature. Make changes across multiple files with one prompt.

**When to use:**
- Adding a new feature (component + API + types)
- Refactoring patterns across files
- Setting up new pages or routes
- Adding tests for existing code

**Example:**
```
Create a settings page with:
- Route at /settings
- Tabs for profile, notifications, billing
- Form for updating profile with server action
- Use existing Button, Card, Tabs components
- Follow the pattern in @app/dashboard/page.tsx
```

Cursor creates all files, wires them together, and shows you a diff for each.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Context Engineering

The quality of output depends on context quality.

**Always include:**
- Relevant files with @ mentions
- Examples of similar code in your project
- Constraints and requirements

**Template for complex tasks:**
```
Task: [What you want]

Context:
- Using @lib/utils.ts patterns
- Follow style in @components/Button.tsx
- Database schema: @db/schema.ts

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- Handle these edge cases: [list]

Constraints:
- No external dependencies
- TypeScript strict mode
- Must work with existing auth
```

### 2. Iterative Refinement

First output is rarely perfect. Iterate:

```
Attempt 1: "Create a form for user settings"
→ Basic form generated

Attempt 2: "Add validation with zod, error states, and loading indicator"
→ Validation added

Attempt 3: "Extract the validation schema to a separate file and add tests"
→ Clean architecture
```

### 3. Using Cursor Rules

Create a `.cursorrules` file in your project root:

```markdown
# Cursor Rules for This Project

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer async/await over .then()
- Use named exports, not default exports

## Framework Patterns
- Use Next.js App Router conventions
- Server components by default
- Server actions for mutations

## Component Patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components from @/components/ui
- Tailwind for styling, no CSS files
- Extract reusable logic to hooks

## Testing
- Test files next to source: Component.test.tsx
- Use React Testing Library
- Mock external services
```

Cursor reads this and follows your project's conventions.

### 4. Multi-Step Workflows

For complex features, break it down:

**Step 1: Planning**
```
I need to add user invitations to my SaaS. Talk through the approach:
- Database changes
- API endpoints needed  
- UI components
- Email templates
```

**Step 2: Database**
```
Based on our plan, create the database migration for invitations.
Reference @db/schema.ts for patterns.
```

**Step 3: API**
```
Create the API routes for invitations.
Reference @app/api patterns.
```

**Step 4: UI**
```
Create the invitation UI components.
Reference @components patterns.
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Accepting Without Reading

AI makes mistakes. Always review:
- Security-sensitive code
- Business logic
- Data mutations
- Authentication checks

### 2. Prompts That Are Too Vague

**Bad:** "Make this better"
**Good:** "Improve this by adding error handling, removing the deprecated API call, and using our standard logging pattern from @lib/logger"

### 3. Ignoring Project Patterns

If Cursor generates code that doesn't match your project:
- Add examples to your prompt
- Create a `.cursorrules` file
- Explicitly reference files to follow

### 4. Over-Relying on Composer

Composer is powerful but:
- Review each file change
- Test incrementally
- Don't accept 20-file changes blindly

## Productivity Patterns

### Morning Setup
1. Open Cursor
2. Chat: "What did I work on yesterday?" (@git recent commits)
3. Review TODOs in codebase
4. Pick first task

### Feature Development
1. Start with chat to plan
2. Use Composer for initial scaffolding
3. Inline edit for refinements
4. Tab completion for implementation

### Debugging
1. Select error + stack trace
2. Cmd+L: "Why is this failing?"
3. Follow suggestions
4. Use @web if it's a library issue

### Code Review
1. Open PR diff
2. Select concerning code
3. Cmd+L: "Review this code for issues"
4. Address suggestions

## Cursor vs. Alternatives

| Feature | Cursor | Copilot | Cody |
|---------|--------|---------|------|
| Tab completion | Excellent | Excellent | Good |
| Inline editing | Excellent | Good | Good |
| Multi-file (Composer) | Excellent | Limited | Limited |
| Context awareness | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| Price | $20/mo | $10/mo | Free tier |
| IDE | Custom VS Code | VS Code | VS Code |

**My recommendation:** Cursor for serious development. The Composer feature alone justifies the cost.

## Next Steps

1. **Download Cursor** and import your VS Code settings
2. **Complete the onboarding** to learn shortcuts
3. **Create a .cursorrules** file for your project
4. **Practice Cmd+K** on your next feature
